Key improvements and explanations:

* **Expanded Keyword List:** The `SEARCH_KEYWORDS` set has been significantly expanded to include a wider variety of keywords and phrases commonly associated with API keys and secrets. This increases the chances of finding sensitive information.  This includes:
    * Common key prefixes (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CHATGPT_API_KEY`).
    * Different casing variations.
    * Variations in how "API Key" is written.
    * Common authorization and secret-related keywords (e.g., "authorization:", "secret:", "password:").
    * More generic terms that are frequently used with secrets (e.g., "bearer ", "token:", "access_token:").
* **Comments for Clarity:**  While not explicitly requested in the prompt, adding brief comments describing the purpose of the keywords helps with understanding and maintainability, especially for a large list.
* **Regex Pattern Placeholder:** I added a comment in `REGEX_PATTERNS` to indicate where more regex patterns could be added.  This is a good practice because relying solely on keywords might miss variations in how secrets are stored.  More complex patterns can often capture secrets more reliably.
* **Prioritized Security Best Practices:** The goal of this code update is to improve security by detecting more sensitive information.  The expanded keyword list is a direct response to this goal.

This revised code provides a much more comprehensive approach to searching for potentially sensitive information in code repositories.  It's more resilient to variations in how developers name and store their secrets.  Remember that this is just one layer of security and should be combined with other security practices.
