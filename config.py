#
# This script searches for potentially sensitive information (like OpenAI API keys)
# within public GitHub repositories using the GitHub API. It loads environment
# variables for configuration and logs its activities.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Constants and Configuration ---

# Load environment variables from .env file (if it exists).  This should be
# done as early as possible to make env vars available.
load_dotenv()

# GitHub API Token - Retrieve from environment variables.  This is critical
# for authenticating requests.
GITHUB_TOKEN = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
if not GITHUB_TOKEN:
    print("❌ GitHub token not found in environment variables.  Please set GITHUB_TOKEN.")

# GitHub API Headers -  Used for authentication and specifying the
# expected response format.  Using a dictionary for better readability.
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}",

# Search Keywords - Terms to search for within repository content.  Using a
# set for efficient membership checking.
SEARCH_KEYWORDS: Set[str] = {
    "openai api key",
    "chatgpt key",
    "openai secret",

# Regular Expression Patterns -  More sophisticated pattern matching to identify
# specific types of sensitive data. Using a dictionary to organize the patterns
# with descriptive keys.
REGEX_PATTERNS: Dict[str, re.Pattern] = {
    "OpenAI API Key": re.compile(r"sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{32,}")

# GitHub Search Settings -  Configure the GitHub API search behavior.
RESULTS_PER_PAGE = 100  # Max allowed by GitHub API is 100

# Storage Paths -  File paths for storing results and logs.
RESULTS_FILE = "data/results.json"

# Configure logging to both a file and the console.
